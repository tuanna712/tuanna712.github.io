Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience in analytics, machine learning, and AI, specializing in chatbot solutions. Backed by 6 years in geophysics at a petroleum institute, focusing on seismic data analysis. Proficient in python, SQL, and graph databases, with a passion for applying data science to drive innovation and efficiency in the energy and other industries.

Education
======
* M.S. in Data Science, University of Colorado Boulder, 2026 (expected)
* B.S. in Geophysical Engineer, Hanoi University of Mining and Geology, 2015

Work experience
======
* 08/2022 – 07/2024 | Data Scientist | Vietnam Petroleum Institue (VPI) | Hanoi, Vietnam
  * Developed a chatbot-operated map-based website that executed user commands for navigation, leveraging a graph database to link map functions with domain knowledge and provide real-time visual results besides chat responses.
  * Developed an internal document-sharing web-based application integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot system, significantly enhancing document sharing capabilities by enabling chatbot interaction with local domain data and optimizing for Vietnamese language.
  * Developed an automated oil field daily reporting system, saving one employee’s daily workload by streamlining data transfer to SQL database, summarization, and reporting (via LLM), while enabling multi-level management supervision.
  * Optimized chatbot reasoning with domain knowledge by generating precise question-answer chains through prompt engineering, and customized integrated chatbots for Microsoft Teams using Automate, Copilot Studio, and Prompt Flow.
  * Developed web application name VPI-Mlogs for applying data tools and some basic machine learning tools to petrophysics borehole data including data loading, anomalies detection, data cleaning, data visualization, missing log prediction.
  * Developed the “vpitools” Python PyPi package for petrophysics data processing, offering quick statistics, 2D/3D visualizations, and customized plotting using matplotlib, seaborn, and interactive charts with plotly and vega-altair.
  * Processed well-log data: detected and removed outliers, duplicated values, normalizing data, feature engineering, optimized size of training and testing dataset, logged and visualized model performance.

* 07/2021 – 07/2022 | Data Analyst | Vietnam Petroleum Institue (VPI) | Hanoi, Vietnam
  * Utilized Microsoft Power Virtual Agents and Power Pages to create domain question-answering system via web application and Microsoft Team agents.
  * Constructed borehole relational database, queried, and visualized logs data in Power BI Dashboard.

* 09/2015 – 06/2021 | Geophysicist | Vietnam Petroleum Institue (VPI) | Hanoi, Vietnam
  * Automatically and semi-automatically interpreted seismic data and built the environmental models to predict the location of potential unstructured oil and gas traps, supporting drilling decisions.
  * Built a velocity model, generated seismic attributes and applied specialized techniques such as Amplitude versus Offset and Inversion, to identify potential field locations and calculate oil reserves.
  * Interpreted seismic data and mapped objects to generate detailed subsurface maps, including structural and attribute maps, with a focus on reservoir characterization.
  
Skills
======
* Database: MySQL, Neo4j, MongoDB, Weaviate, Qdrant.
* Languages: Python (Advanced), HTML-CSS (Intermediate), JavaScript (Intermediate).
* Libraries: Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas.
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair.
* Python web development: Streamlit, Gradio, Github, HuggingFace.
* Petroleum Software: Petrel, Kingdom, Hampson Russell, Paleoscan.
* GIS Software: QGIS, MapInfo, Mapbox Studio, ArcGIS.
