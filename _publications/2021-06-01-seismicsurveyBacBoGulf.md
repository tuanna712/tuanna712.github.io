About 25,000 km of 2D and 6,500 km2 of 3D seismic data have been acquired on the northern part of Bac Bo Gulf. The results of seismic activities help to accurately identify the geological structure and characteristics of the Miocene reservoir and the buried carbonate basement, cavities and fractures which distribute in the inverse zone of blocks 102, 104, and 106, and assess their oil and gas potential. In addition, these seismic data allow the identification of non-structural and stratigraphic traps in the areas considered to be rich in potential, such as the neighbouring areas of Ham Rong and Ky Lan structures as well as other areas of blocks 103&107, and 101 & 100/4. Because of the limitation of the legacy 2D/3D seismic data, it is necessary to continue to deploy new seismic acquisition on a larger area and apply new technologies to improve the efficiency of oil and gas exploration activities in particular and geological studies in general.
