Machine learning is an important part of the data science field. In petrophysics, machine learning algorithms and applications have been widely approached. In this context, Vietnam Petroleum Institute (VPI) has researched and deployed several effective prediction models, namely missing log prediction, fracture zone and fracture density forecast, etc. As one of our solutions, VPI-MLogs is a web-based deployment platform which integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualisation and model execution. Using the most popular data analysis programming language, Python, this approach gives users a powerful tool to deal with the petrophysical logs section. The solution helps to narrow the gap between common knowledge and petrophysics insights. This article will focus on the web-based application which integrates many solutions to grasp petrophysical data.
