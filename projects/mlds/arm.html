            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="h2-content">
                <b>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</b> is a fundamental data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, 
                patterns, and associations among items in large datasets. It is widely applied in market basket analysis, where it 
                helps identify frequently co-occurring items in transactions.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>What is the Apriori algorithm?</b><br> 
                        <b>The Apriori algorithm</b> is a popular method for ARM, which uses a breadth-first search
                        strategy to find frequent itemsets by iteratively generating candidate itemsets and pruning those that do not meet the
                        minimum support threshold. The algorithm efficiently reduces the search space by leveraging the anti-monotonic property of
                        itemsets, which states that if an itemset is infrequent, all of its supersets must also be infrequent. This property allows
                        the algorithm to focus on promising candidates, making it computationally efficient for large datasets.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><b>What are the rules?</b><br>
                        Association rules in the Apriori algorithm define relationships between items in a dataset. 
                        A rule is typically in the form "If X, then Y", meaning that when item X appears in a transaction, item Y is likely to appear as well. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Support: measures how often an itemset appears in the dataset.</li>
                            <li>Confidence: measures the likelihood of one item appearing given the presence of another, e.g: X given Y.</li>
                            <li>Lift:  quantifies the strength of the association between two items by comparing their observed co-occurrence with 
                                their expected co-occurrence if they were independent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>How does it work?</b><br>
                        The Apriori algorithm is a rule-based method for frequent itemset mining in large transactional datasets. 
                        It works by iteratively identifying itemsets that appear frequently in 
                        transactions using a minimum support threshold and then generating association rules from those itemsets. 
                        The process involves pruning infrequent itemsets to improve efficiency and applying the Apriori property, 
                        which states that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.

                <h3>1. Data Preparation</h3>
                <p class="h2-content">
                    To apply Association Rule Mining (ARM), the data must be converted into a transaction format. 
                    Unlike traditional record-based data with fixed columns, transaction data consists of rows 
                    where each row represents a unique transaction containing an unlimited number of items. 
                    A Transaction ID is required to differentiate transactions.<br><br>

                    In the original dataset, categorical columns like LITHOLOGY, BS, GROUP, and FORMATION already exist. 
                    However, to better fit ARM, numerical features were transformed into categorical values through a discretization process. 
                    For example, depth values were categorized into labels such as Shallow, Intermediate, Deep, and Ultra Deep based on predefined ranges. 
                    Similarly, DTC, CALI, NPHI and RHOB were also converted into categorical groups. 
                    Finally, column names were removed, and the data was structured into a basket format, where each row represents 
                    a transaction containing a list of categorized items.<br><br>

                    The comparison of data before and after the transformation is shown in figure below.
