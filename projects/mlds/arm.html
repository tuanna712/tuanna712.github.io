                Association Rule Mining (ARM)
            </h1>

            <p class="h2-content">
                <b>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</b> is a fundamental data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, 
                patterns, and associations among items in large datasets. It is widely applied in market basket analysis, where it 
                helps identify frequently co-occurring items in transactions.<br><br>

                ARM is based on three key metrics: support, which measures how often an itemset appears in the 
                dataset, and confidence, which indicates the likelihood of one item appearing given the presence of another, finally, lift, which
                quantifies the strength of the association between two items by comparing their observed co-occurrence with their expected
                co-occurrence if they were independent.<br><br>

                The Apriori algorithm is a popular method for ARM, which uses a breadth-first search
                strategy to find frequent itemsets by iteratively generating candidate itemsets and pruning those that do not meet the
                minimum support threshold. The algorithm efficiently reduces the search space by leveraging the anti-monotonic property of
                itemsets, which states that if an itemset is infrequent, all of its supersets must also be infrequent. This property allows
                the algorithm to focus on promising candidates, making it computationally efficient for large datasets.<br>
