            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="h2-content">
                <b>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</b> is a fundamental data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, 
                patterns, and associations among items in large datasets. It is widely applied in market basket analysis, where it 
                helps identify frequently co-occurring items in transactions.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>What is the Apriori algorithm?</b><br> 
                        <b>The Apriori algorithm</b> is a popular method for ARM, which uses a breadth-first search
                        strategy to find frequent itemsets by iteratively generating candidate itemsets and pruning those that do not meet the
                        minimum support threshold. The algorithm efficiently reduces the search space by leveraging the anti-monotonic property of
                        itemsets, which states that if an itemset is infrequent, all of its supersets must also be infrequent. This property allows
                        the algorithm to focus on promising candidates, making it computationally efficient for large datasets.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><b>What are the rules?</b><br>
                        Association rules in the Apriori algorithm define relationships between items in a dataset. 
                        A rule is typically in the form "If X, then Y", meaning that when item X appears in a transaction, item Y is likely to appear as well. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Support: measures how often an itemset appears in the dataset.</li>
                            <li>Confidence: measures the likelihood of one item appearing given the presence of another, e.g: X given Y.</li>
                            <li>Lift:  quantifies the strength of the association between two items by comparing their observed co-occurrence with 
                                their expected co-occurrence if they were independent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>How does it work?</b><br>
                        The Apriori algorithm is a rule-based method for frequent itemset mining in large transactional datasets. 
                        It works by iteratively identifying itemsets that appear frequently in 
                        transactions using a minimum support threshold and then generating association rules from those itemsets. 
                        The process involves pruning infrequent itemsets to improve efficiency and applying the Apriori property, 
                        which states that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.

                    <b>How ARM is used in this project?</b><br>
                    In this project, we applied ARM to the dataset to identify patterns and relationships of lithology types with other features.
                    For example, the ARM can figure out whether the Sandstone type is more likely to occur with a specific depth, porosity ranges or any specific formation.
                    The set of rules generated from the ARM can provide valuable insights which links the properties of each feature with the lithology types.

                <h3>1. Data Preparation</h3>
                <p class="h2-content">
                    To apply Association Rule Mining (ARM), the data must be converted into a transaction format. 
                    Unlike traditional record-based data with fixed columns, transaction data consists of rows 
                    where each row represents a unique transaction containing an unlimited number of items. 
                    A Transaction ID is required to differentiate transactions.<br><br>

                    In the original dataset, categorical columns like LITHOLOGY, BS, GROUP, and FORMATION already exist. 
                    However, to better fit ARM, numerical features were transformed into categorical values through a discretization process. 
                    For example, depth values were categorized into labels such as Shallow, Intermediate, Deep, and Ultra Deep based on predefined ranges. 
                    Similarly, DTC, CALI, NPHI and RHOB were also converted into categorical groups. 
                    Finally, column names were removed, and the data was structured into a basket format, where each row represents 
                    a transaction containing a list of categorized items.<br><br>

                    The label column is dropped to focus on the association rules between the features.<br><br>

                    The comparison of data before and after the transformation is shown in figure below.

                    It discloses thar Low Porosity is the most common item with nearly 80% of transactions, followed by MidVelocity and DeepDepth.<br>
                    In other words, we can say that 80% of the Porosity is in low interval, 70% of the velocity is in mid interval and 65% of the data is gauged in deep borehole.

                    The "Top 15 Rules of Support" from the figure above display the most frequently co-occurring items in the transaction data. 
                    The highest support rule, "BS85" and "LowPorosity" with a support of 0.58, indicates that borehole size of 8.5 inches and 
                    low porosity are commonly found together in the dataset. The third most frequent rule, "MidRHOB" and "MidVelocity" with 56%
                     support, suggests a relationship where rock density is directly linked to the velocity of wave propagation in the rock. 
                     These rules can help identify physical relationships, though some associations may require further investigation to fully 
                     understand the connections between features.<br><br>

                    The "Top 15 Rules of Confidence" in the figure above highlight the strongest associations between items in the transaction data. 
                    The highest confidence rule, "{MidVelocity, VeryNarrowCaliper} → BS85" with a confidence of 1, means that whenever the velocity 
                    is in the mid-range and the caliper is very narrow, the borehole size is always 8.5 inches. Similarly, the second rule indicates
                     that when the velocity is mid-range, the caliper is very narrow, and the porosity is low, the borehole size is certainly 8.5 inches. 
                     These relationships reflect physical properties and drilling conditions, such as caliper size, which measures borehole diameter 
                     and impacts drilling performance. Other rules can be interpreted in a similar manner.<br><br>

                    The "Top 15 Rules of Lift" in the figure above highlight the strongest mutual associations between items in the transaction data.
                    Instead of one way association like confidence, the lift measures the strength of the association between two items.
                    The results are sorted descendingly, therefore all 15 rules are larger than 1, which indicates that the items are positively correlated.
                    The highest lift rule, "{BS85, LowPorosity, MidVelocity} → VeryNarrowCaliper" with a lift of 1.772, means that this is strong set of items
                    where the borehole size of 8.5 inches, low porosity, and mid velocity are likely to occur together with a very narrow caliper. 
                    Similarly, all other confidence can be interpreted.<br><br>

                    <b>Network visualization</b><br>
                    The graph network visualization in ARM represents association rules as nodes (items) and edges (connections between items in a rule). 
                    The thickness of edges indicates the strength of relationships, with thicker edges representing stronger associations. 
                    Node size reflects item frequency, where larger nodes appear more often in transactions. Colors often indicate rule strength, 
                    light red for weaker rules, red for moderate associations, and green for strong, high-confidence relationships. 
                    This visualization helps identify key item relationships and uncover meaningful patterns in the dataset.

<!-- Conclusion -->
            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                By applying the Apriori algorithm, several association rules were identified, uncovering meaningful relationships between features. 
                The results indicate that most gauged porosity falls within the low range, velocity tends to be in the mid-range, and a borehole 
                size of 8.5 inches is commonly associated with narrow and very narrow calipers. Additionally, the majority of wells are deep, and 
                rock density measurements typically fall within the mid-range.<br>
                There is a strong correlation between the borehole size and the caliper size, as well as between the velocity and rock density.
                The top lift rules indicate that the combination of borehole size 8.5, low porosity, and medium velocity is likely to occur with a very narrow caliper.
