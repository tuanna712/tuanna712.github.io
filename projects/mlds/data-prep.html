        <p class="h3-content">
            Oil and gas exploration data is highly expensive and resource-intensive. 
            Drilling operations and seismic surveys can cost millions or even tens of millions of dollars. 
            As a result, the availability of such data is limited compared to conventional datasets. 
            Additionally, training machine learning models requires labeled data, which is not readily 
            available in raw datasets and necessitates expert involvement for annotation.
        </p>

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Why</b></p> -->

        <p class="h3-content">
            In this project, data is collected through two main methods: retrieving data via the USGS API and downloading data 
            from the FORCE ML Competition. While USGS provides raw data (without labels) accessible via API, FORCE offers labeled data, which 
            is crucial for supervised machine learning algorithms.

                    The raw data is organized into files, with each file containing information for an individual well. 
                    An <strong>LAS file</strong> consists of a <strong>header</strong> and a <strong>tabular data section</strong>.

                3D Scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between three curves. In this plot, the relationship between RHOB, NPHI, and GR is shown.
                In addition, the color represents the lithofacies. The size offers the depth information. Generally, this plot provides 5 dimensions of information. 
                Using the rotation, the relationship between the curves can be observed from different angles. The disadvantage is that it can not add the trend lines 
                and also difficult to interpret the relationship between the curves.

                        <b>Data Summary:</b> The dataset contains more than 90 wells with over 2 million rows and 28 columns. 
                                However, it also includes null values, and only 1.4 million rows have labels. Additionally, some important 
                                curves, such as DTS, DCAL, and MUD, are represented by a small amount of data. Outliers are also present in 
                                some logs, resulting from human or machine errors. After removing null values, unnecessary columns, and processing 
                                outliers, the cleaned dataset consists of more than 300K rows and 18 columns, including labels.

                            <b>Insights:</b>
                            The label data is imbalanced, with the majority of samples belonging to the Shale class. It requires a specific 
                            strategy to handle this imbalance, such as resampling techniques (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) 
                            or using algorithms that are robust to imbalanced data.

                            The features contain some data from some similar geophysical logging methods, such as RDEP, RSHA, RMED, RXO, and RMIC.
                            These features are highly correlated, and it is necessary to perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

                        <b>Next Steps:</b>
                        To understand deeply the relationship and preparing for training data, next steps involve exploring the dataset using advanced 
                        techniques such as: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</b> to reduce dimensionality and identify key features.</li>
                            <li><b>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</b> to discover relationships between features.</li>
                            <li><b>Unsupervised clustering methods</b> like K-Means or DBSCAN to uncover natural groupings in the data.</li>
                            <li><b>Feature selection:</b> Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or Lasso regression to retain the most relevant features 
                                and remove unnecessary ones, improving model performance and interpretability.</li>
