        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="h3-content">Starting his second term, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency, 
            citing an “inadequate and intermittent energy supply” that fails to meet the country's growing demands, as stated in 
            <strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank"> SECTION 1 - DECLARING A NATIONAL ENERGY EMERGENCY</strong>. </a>
        </p>
        
        <p class="h3-content">One of the key activities in the energy industry is oil and gas exploration drilling, a process that is time-consuming, costly, and requires highly skilled personnel. According to reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the cost of drilling a well can exceed $4 million.</p>

            Costs of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Wells Drilled  (Source: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_wellcost_s1_a.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Energy Information Administration)</a>
            <br>
            A survey of drilling costs for new wells in the United States from 2002 to 2007 showed that by 2007, a production well cost approximately $4 million, while a dry hole could cost as much as $6 million.

        <h3>Well Log Data</h3>
        <p class="h3-content">A significant portion of the operations and costs is dedicated to acquiring and interpreting well-log data, which provides crucial information on lithologies, physical indicators, and oil and gas behavior. This data plays a key role in guiding exploration and drilling decisions.</p>
        <p class="h3-content">However, due to cost and time constraints, many well-log data points are omitted or not collected, resulting in missing indicators that experts rely on for analysis. Well-log interpretation often takes weeks or even months to process, depending on the number of wells and the quality of the data.</p>

            Well logs are printed records where each curve represents a different physical property of the rock, such as gamma ray, resistivity, and density. 
            They also include indicators of gas behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>Missing Well-Log</h3>
        <p class="h3-content">These interpretation tasks require experienced experts with many years of specialization. 
            However, the processes are repetitive across wells and can be learned from data. With the rapid advancement 
            of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, well-log interpretation can be significantly accelerated 
            through automated analysis with high accuracy. These solutions reduce both time and costs while enabling 
            faster and more precise drilling decisions.</p>
        <p class="h3-content">
            This project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict missing well-log data and classify lithologies based on the available well-log data. 
            By automating these tasks, the accuracy of well-log interpretation could be improved, enabling faster decision-making in oil and gas exploration and drilling.
        </p>

        <h3>Lithology Classification</h3>
        <p class="h3-content">Lithology classification refers to the process of identifying and categorizing rock types based on well-log data. It is essential for understanding subsurface geology, optimizing drilling strategies, and improving reservoir characterization.</p>
