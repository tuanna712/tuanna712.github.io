        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="h2-content">Starting his second term, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency, 
                citing an “inadequate and intermittent energy supply” that fails to meet the country's growing demands, as stated in 
                <strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank"> SECTION 1 - DECLARING A NATIONAL ENERGY EMERGENCY</strong>. </a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="h2-content">One of the key activities in the energy industry is oil and gas exploration, a process that is time-consuming, costly, and requires highly skilled personnel. According to reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the cost of drilling a well can exceed $4 million.</p>
            <div class="image">

                Costs of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Wells Drilled  (Source: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_wellcost_s1_a.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Energy Information Administration)</a>
                <br>
                A survey of drilling costs for new wells in the United States from 2002 to 2007 showed that by 2007, a production well cost approximately $4 million, while a dry hole could cost as much as $6 million.

        <section>
            <p class="h2-content">A significant portion of the operations and costs is dedicated to acquiring and interpreting well-log data, which provides 
                crucial information on lithologies, physical indicators, and oil and gas behavior. This data plays a key role in guiding exploration and 
                drilling decisions.</p>

            <p class="h2-content">
                In general, well log interpretation plays a fundamental role in oil and gas exploration and the entire drilling process, as it provides critical insights 
                into the subsurface formations. It allows geologists and engineers to identify potential hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs by analyzing key properties 
                such as porosity, permeability, and fluid saturation. Through various logging techniques, such as gamma-ray, resistivity, and neutron-density logging, 
                experts can distinguish between rock types like sandstone, shale, and limestone, ensuring accurate reservoir characterization.
            </p>
            
            <p class="h2-content">
                One of the primary objectives of well log interpretation is to evaluate the formation and estimate hydrocarbon reserves. 
                By analyzing resistivity logs, engineers can determine whether a formation contains oil, gas, or water, while neutron-density logs provide a clear 
                indication of porosity and fluid content. This information is crucial in estimating the volume of recoverable hydrocarbons, helping operators assess 
                the economic feasibility of a reservoir before making significant investments in production infrastructure.
            </p>
            
            <p class="h2-content">
                During the drilling process, well logs play a key role in optimizing operations and ensuring wellbore stability. 
                Logging-while-drilling (LWD) and measurement-while-drilling (MWD) technologies provide real-time data that helps drillers adjust the well trajectory, 
                allowing them to stay within the most productive reservoir zones. This not only enhances hydrocarbon recovery but also minimizes drilling risks such 
                as differential sticking, wellbore collapse, and formation damage. Additionally, formation pressure analysis derived from well logs is crucial in 
                detecting overpressure zones, preventing hazardous situations like blowouts and well failures.
            </p>

            <p class="h2-content">However, due to cost and time constraints, many well-log data points are omitted or not collected, resulting in missing indicators that experts rely on for analysis. 
                In addition, well-log interpretation often takes weeks or even months to process, depending on the number of wells and the quality of the data.</p>

                Well logs are printed records where each curve represents a different physical property of the rock, such as gamma ray, resistivity, and density. 
                They also include indicators of gas behavior.
            </p>
            <p class="h2-content">These interpretation tasks require experienced experts with many years of specialization. 
                However, the processes are repetitive across wells and can be learned from data.
            </p>
            <p class="h2-content">
                With the rapid advancement of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, well-log interpretation can be significantly accelerated 
                through automated analysis with high accuracy. These solutions reduce both time and costs while enabling 
                faster and more precise drilling decisions.
